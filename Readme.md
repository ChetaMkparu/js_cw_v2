# Code Practice - Practice code.

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

```js

Enter base: 20

Enter height: 10
// Response: The area of the triangle is 100

```

2. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

```js

Enter side a: 5

Enter side b: 4

Enter side c: 3

// Response: The perimeter of the triangle is 12

```

3. Write a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

```js

Enter hours: 40

Enter rate per hour: 28

// Response: Your weekly earning is 1120

```

_Further Research: Research the input method "prompt()"._

_ND: Try your best to solve this without AI. For team presentation, i'll pick one of this questions for any of your team members to code live in class on saturday._
